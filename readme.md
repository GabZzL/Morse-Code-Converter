# Text to Morse Code and Morse Code to Text Converter

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Python application that converts text to Morse code and Morse code back to text. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. This project provides a practical tool for understanding and working with Morse code, which has historical significance in communication.

## Features

- **Text to Morse Code Conversion**: Input a text string, and the application converts each character to its corresponding Morse code representation.
- **Morse Code to Text Conversion**: Input a Morse code string, and the application decodes it back into readable text.
- **Handling of Common Punctuation**: The converter supports common punctuation marks in addition to alphanumeric characters.
- **Space**: The space is represented by '/' in Morse code. It is important in both conversions.
